* Error when launching MPI applications

	This is usually caused by whether remote nodes are "reachable"
	without typing "password." In your everyday life, if you ssh to
	a node, and always required password, this may be a "big" trouble 
	for MPI applications. See http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=rsh
	for how to set up your ssh. Also, http://www.funtoo.org/wiki/Keychain
	is a good starting point to set up ssh with the "keychain" utility
	under Linux.
