MT evaluations especially for MERT purpose

BLEU: IBM Bleu (TODO: implement NIST-bleu, average-bleu?)
WER: word error rate
PER: position independent word error rate
TER: translation error rate
SB: skip bigram (by default, skip size is clipped to 4)
WLCS: (weighted) longest common subsequence (by defaut, weight is one, meaning no weight, use alpha=2 for weight?)
SK: string kernel (by default, decay factor = 0.8, spectrum p = 4)
