Do we allow state-less features applied during composition???
	We need composition-based features for phrase-based MT
	to compute distortion/lexicalized reordering etc. not represented in
	hypergraph struct

	State-less features are sometimes related to composition algorithm,
	such as shift-reduce etc.

Support tree-to-tree transduction:
	Support non-tree transducer matching:
	match with phrases or hierarchical phrases whose spans match with
	syntactic spans.

Better MIRA training

System combination as statitical generation
  Parse nbests
  Collect rules
  Generate from rules

Use source side tree-fragment as a rule, and parse "lattice"
    Simply convert source side into a flat structure and parse via CKY
    	   + additional checking for target-side!
    Allow special encoding in tree-grammar...

Add Matcher interface?
