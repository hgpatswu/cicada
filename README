cicada

A statistical machine translation toolkit based on a semiring parsing framework[1].
Based on the generic framework, we can
   - learn model
   - translate sentence

Remark: cicada is 蝉, (or セミ) in Japanese, pronounsed "SEMI"

Basically we have three distinct structures:
   - lattice: a representation of graph implemented as a two-dimentional array.
   - grammar: a collection of WFST implemented as a trie structure.
   - hypergraph: a compact representation of forest.

Translation can be carried out by:
   - A lattice is composed with a grammar by generating a hypergraph [2].
   or
   - A hypergraph is composed with a grammar by generating another hypergraph [3].

After the hypergraph generation, you can:
   - Additional features are evaluated to generate another hypergraph [4].
   - K-bests sentences are generated from hypergraph [5].

Learning consists of two framework:
  - Large feature set from input lattice/hypergraph learnt via MaxEnt [3] (TODO)
  - Large feature set during model application [6] (TODO)
  - Small feature set learned by hypergraph-MERT [7]
