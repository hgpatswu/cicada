cicada

A statistical machine translation toolkit based on a semiring parsing framework.
Based on the generic framework, we can
   - learn grammar
   - align bitext
   - translate sentence

Basically we have three distinct structures:
   - lattice: a representation of graph implemented as a two-dimentional array.
   - grammar: a collection of WFST implemented as a trie structure.
   - hypergraph: a compact representation of forest.

Translation can be carried out by:
   - A lattice is composed with a grammar by generating a hypergraph.
   or
   - A hypergraph is composed with a grammar by generating another hypergraph.

After the hypergraph generation, you can:
   - Additional features are evaluated to generate another hypergraph.
   - K-bests sentences are generated from hypergraph.

Remark: cicada is 蝉, (or セミ) in Japanese, pronounsed "semi"
