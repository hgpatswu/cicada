cicada

A statistical machine translation toolkit based on a semiring parsing framework[1].
Based on the generic framework, we can
   - learn model(s): tree-to-string, string-to-tree, string-to-string (with latent tree)
   - translate sentence, lattice and/or parse tree

Remark: cicada is 蝉, (or セミ) in Japanese, pronounced "SEMI"

Basically, we have three distinct structures:
   - lattice: a representation of graph implemented as a two-dimentional array.
   - grammar: a collection of WFST implemented as a trie structure.
   - hypergraph: a compact representation of forest.

Translation can be carried out by:
   - A lattice (or sentence) is composed with a grammar by generating a hypergraph [2].
   or
   - A hypergraph (or parse-tree) is composed with a grammar by generating another hypergraph [3].

After the hypergraph generation, you can:
   - Additional features are evaluated to generate another hypergraph [4].
      * cicada implementes cube-pruning [4], cube-growing [4], incremental (Huang and Mi, 2010) and exact (and stateless-inside-algorithm) methods
      * cube-growing employs coarse-heuristics [11], such as lower-order ngrams etc.
   - Perform variational decoding for hypergraph [10].
   - Perform MBR decoding for hypergraph [12].
      * Above two computations rely on expected ngram-counts over forest [13].
   - K-bests sentences are generated from hypergraph [5].

Or, you can combine outputs from multiple systems by (New! and TODO):
   - Perform parsing over nbests (use your favorite parser, such as Berkeley parser/Stanford parser etc.)
   - Generate context-free confusion forest by combining trees (not confusion network!)
      * It is performed by collecting rules from parse trees, and generate by Earley algorithm (New!)
   - Generate k-best translations after feature application etc.

Various learning components are implemented:
   - Large feature set from input lattice/hypergraph on large training data via MaxEnt [3]
   - Large feature set on small devset with MIRA [6,7], but with hypergraph (New! But still open problems!)
   - Small feature set on small devset learned by hypergraph-MERT [8]
   - Small/Large feature set on small devset learned by hypergraph-MaxEnt (New! But still open problems!) + softmax-margin [9]
