cicada

A statistical machine translation toolkit based on a semiring parsing framework[1].
Based on the generic framework, we can
   - learn model(s): tree-to-string, string-to-tree, string-to-string (with or without latent tree), word alignment, grammar for parsing
   - translate sentence, lattice and/or parse tree
   - align between {hypergraph,lattice}-to-lattice (currently, we assume penn-treebank style hypergraph and sentence-like lattice)
   - parse lattices (or sentences)
   - analyze forest/tree/lattice

Remark: cicada is 蝉(CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-8749), (or セミ) in Japanese, pronounced "SEMI"

Basically, we have four distinct structures:
   - lattice: a representation of graph implemented as a two-dimentional array.
   - grammar: a collection of WFST implemented as a trie structure.
   - tree-grammar: a collectin of WFSTT (tree-transducer) implemented as a (nested) trie structure.
   - hypergraph: a compact representation of set of trees (or forest).

Translation/parsing can be carried out by:
   - A lattice (or sentence) is composed with a grammar, generating a hypergraph [2,24].
   - A lattice (or sentence) is composed with a tree-grammar, generating a hypergraph [27].
   - A lattice (or sentence) is composed with a phrasal grammar, generating a phrasal hypergraph [4].
   - A hypergraph/forest (or parse-tree) is composed with a phrasal grammar, generating another hypergraph [3].
   - A hypergraph/forest (or parse-tree) is composed with a tree grammar, generating another hypergraph [4]. (experimental)

Alignment can be carried out by:
   - A lattice is composed with dictionary, generating alignment hypergraph, or
   - A hypergraph is composed with dictinary, generating alignment hypergraph [20].
     
     In order to support word alignment training, we can learn Model1 lexicon model
     by symmetized learning [22] or posterior constrained learning [23] with smoothing
     via variational Bayes.

After the hypergraph generation, you can:
   - Additional features are evaluated to generate another hypergraph [4].
      * cicada implementes cube-pruning [4], cube-growing [4], incremental [18]
        and exact (and stateless-inside-algorithm) methods
      * cube-growing employs coarse-heuristics [11], such as lower-order ngrams etc.
   - Perform variational decoding for hypergraph [10].
   - Perform MBR decoding for hypergraph [12].
      * Above two computations rely on expected ngram-counts over forest [13].
   - K-best sentences are generated from hypergraph [5].
   - Generate oracle translations (BLEU only).

Or, you can combine outputs from multiple systems by (New! and TODO):
   - Perform parsing over nbests (use your favorite parser, such as Berkeley parser/Stanford parser etc.)
   - Generate context-free confusion forest by combining trees (not confusion network!)
      * It is performed by collecting rules from parse trees, and generate by Earley algorithm (New!)
   - Generate k-best translations after feature application etc.

   Or, a conventional strategy of [14]:
   - Create lattice from n-best list by incremental merging
   - Construct hypergraph by linear grammar (grammar-glue-straight + grammar-insertion)
   - Generate k-best translations after feature application etc.

Monolingual grammar learning is implemented:
   - A simple PCFG by simply extracting rules.
   - Learn latent annotated PCFG by split/merge process with an EM algorihtm [25].
   - Also, learn coarse grammars from the latent annotated PCFG for coarse-to-fine parsing [26].

Phrase/synchronou-rule/tree-to-string/string-to-tree extraction/scoring are implemented:
   - A conventional phrase extract algorithm in Moses
   - A conventional hierarchical phrase extraction algorithm in Hiero
      + syntax augmented rule extraction is also supported [15]
   - Tree-to-string/strint-to-tree extractin from forest [16,27]
   - Tree-to-tree rule extraction from forest [17] (TODO!)
   
   - After count extraction, you can perform map/reduce to compute model scores [19]

Various learning components are implemented:
   - Large feature set from input lattice/hypergraph on large training data via MaxEnt (optimized by LBFGS) [3]
   - Large feature set on small devset with MIRA [6,7], but with hypergraph (New! But still open problems!)
   - Small feature set on small devset learned by hypergraph-MERT [8]
   - Small/Large feature set on small devset learned by hypergraph-MaxEnt (optimized by LBFGS or SGD)
     + softmax-margin [9] (New! But still open problems!)

Word clustering tool is also included to support word alignment learning + translation [20]
