Parsing by cicada
=================

The cicada toolkit can parse texts using either penn-treebank-style
constituency grammar or CoNLL-style dependency grammar. Note that the
capabiliy of parsing does not imply the state-of-the-art performance,
but merely means that the toolkit is generic enought to support
parsing, not only translation.
