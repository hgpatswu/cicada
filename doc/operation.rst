For the list of operations, see "cicada --operation-list".
In cicada, operations are applied  via --operation [op] in the order specified by command line
or by a config file. "output" must be placed as its final operations, otherwise, you will easily mess up,
though you can mix and give multiple outputs...

You can treat the sequence of operations in SIMD (single-instruction multiple-data) fashion, 
in which the same sequence of operations is applied to each data (potentially in parallel).
