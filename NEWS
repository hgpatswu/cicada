2011-4-18
Added coarse-to-fine parsing
Added coarse grammar learning
Added epsilon-removal for hypergraph
Added no-bos-eos option to ngram feature which will not score via <s> </s>, assuming <s> and </s> are used in grammar
Reworked attribute vector for smaller memory allocation (but slower for insert/erase)
Use -99 for unigram probability of <s> taken from SRILM

2011-3-28
New grammar API: use --grammar and/or --tree-grammar only, and removed options, such as --grammar-static etc.
Added parser component. Currently, we support tabular-CKY and bottom-up agenda-based best-first search with pruning.
Added parseval evaluator.
Added grammar learner based on latent annotation grammar
Better scanner/generator for hypergraph/lattice structures etc. by eliminating (potentially slower) symbol-tables.

2011-2-14
Better vocabulary management by eliminating temporary buffer
Use boost.spirit for parsing/generating numerics

2011-1-17
Support tree-to-string translation (probably, the code will work for tree-to-tree)
Added sort-tail operation which sort tails by its order in rule's non-terminal index.
Added lexicon learning (dice and model1 via cicada_lexicon_{dice,model1}) and lexicon model learning from word alignment (cicada_lexicon)
Added word-cluster learning (cicada_cluster_word)
Added filter for forest-charniak and egret (cicada_filter_charniak) and CONLL-X (cicada_filter_conll)
Added moses compatible phrase/synchronous-CFG rule/GHKM rule/tree2tree rule extraction script (cicada-extract.py)
Added string-to-tree GHKM extraction by flipping source/target side in tree-to-string extraction

2010-12-22
Added new API for mt-evaluation score allowing ascii-dumping by desciption/encode and recovery by decode.
GHKM and Tree extractor first computes terminal span, and removed span-forest from cicada_fitler_{penntreebank,cabocha}

2010-12-20
Serious bugfix to ngram-related features with double counting.
Serious bugfix to expected ngram collections
Added preliminary head-finder
Added approximate matcher to cicada_unite_sentence and TER/WER

2010-12-13
Added phrase-extract-like script, extract.py, for easily extracting/scoreing phrase/scfg/ghkm.
Added alignment tool, cicada_alignment (do we need this?) (TODO: add ITG alignment + threading)
Added matching API, word matcher using lower-case, stemming and wordnet synsets(!) (TODO: use this for TER etc.)
Added wordnet API (we use the standard c-interface wrapped by thread-safe API)
Modified "permute" so that permutation rules are stored in attributes and permute-feature can access and perform scoring.

2010-11-28
Added "attribute" in each hyperedge which can store key-value pair with arbitray value type: 64-bit-int, double float or string.
Cache rule allocation in hypergraph for better memory consumption

2010-11-22
Support tree transduction (but experimental)
Removed bi-rules in hypergraph: removed "yield" in features etc. but added in compositional operations.
Added phrase/synchronous-rule/GHKM-rule extractor + score accumulator
Added tokenizer, and use it for MT evaluators and bleu-related features
Added new API for word normalizer (stemmer or cluster) and use it for sparce features
Added remove-epsilon for lattice
Added linguistic stemmer (snowball and LDC's Arabic stemmer)

2010-10-31
Support phrase-based composition with length-based distortion
and lexicalized-reordering (experimental, and only for monotonic lattice)

2010-10-23
Added ter/wer/per
Added cicada_unite_{hypergraph,lattice,sentence} to perform merging
Added Earley generator with contextual category
Support epsilon in lattice

2010-9-6
Added expected-ngram computer
Added expected-BLEU feature
Added ngram-count-set structure
Moved operation/operation_set into global

2010-8-27
Added cube-growing with order-based coarse heuristic

"Quietly" revised grammar-static structure

2010-8-26
Implemented cube-pruning and cube-growing for faster rescoring
